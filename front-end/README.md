## üèÅ Running application

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),so make sure you have the last stable version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) running locally.

Firstly you should had already cloned the whole repository. If you haven't, run this command in your machine's terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/lguilhermefl/projeto21-singmeasong.git
```

After you had it cloned, open the main folder in your code editor. With the terminal opened run the following commands to install all dependencies:

```
cd front-end/
npm i
```

After that you'll need to create your .env file with your back-end url. Running locally without changing the default port in back-end server file it should be "http://localhost:5000". You can check the .env.example file for example.
To run:

```
npm start
```

:stop_sign: Don't forget to repeat the steps above also using the [backend repository](https://github.com/lguilhermefl/projeto21-singmeasong/tree/main/back-end) to fully test the project
